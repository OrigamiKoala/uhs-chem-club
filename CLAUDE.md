# Avalon — Engineering Reference

Avalon is the UHS Chemistry Club's competition portal. Its audience is middle- and
high-school students who know little or no chemistry, so the product rule that outranks
everything else is: **teach through play, reveal vocabulary last.** A player draws lines
between glowing regions for twenty stages and only meets the words "electron", "curved
arrow" and "steric hindrance" in the epilogue, after the intuition is already built.

## Build and Run
- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server on port 3000 with the API handler mounted as middleware.
- `npm run build` — production assets into `dist/`.
- `npm run verify` — `verify:quest` + `verify:flows` + `build`. Run this before shipping.
- `npm run verify:quest` — static integrity check of all 20 Quest 1 stages (see below).
- `npm run verify:flows` — end-to-end smoke test of the API a new student touches.
- `npm run deploy:backend` — `clasp push` of `apps-script/`.
- `npm run bake:stills` — regenerate the static SVG backdrops in `public/fallback/`.
- `npm run seed` / `npm run test:load` — roster seeding and 40-user concurrency sim.

## Architecture

### Client (`src/`)
- `main.js` — boots the 3D stage, HUD and router immediately, then fetches `bootstrap`
  in the background so first paint never waits on the network.
- `router.js` — hash router. `ROUTES` declares auth/admin gating; `ROUTE_NAV` maps a route
  to the HUD nav button that should light up; unknown hashes normalize to `#/`. Closes any
  open modal and exits the quest scene on navigation.
- `session.js` — token, player, team, XP, inventory and progress, persisted in
  `localStorage` and restored synchronously at boot. Exports `levelForXp`, `levelProgress`
  and `levelTitle` — **the only XP curve in the client** (45·(N−1)² per level, capped at
  level 12 to match `Scoring.gs`). Server XP is authoritative: `setUserData` overwrites the
  local total unless called with `{ trustXp: false }` (used by `player/create`, which does
  not return a real total).
- `api.js` — thin POST wrapper; clears the session on `UNAUTHORIZED`.
- `ui/layout.js` — `pageHeader`, `statRow`, `stepRail`, `emptyState`, `esc`. **Every screen
  builds its header from `pageHeader`**; do not hand-roll banner/title markup.
- `ui/modal.js` — `showModal` / `closeModal`, with focus handling and Escape to dismiss.
- `ui/toast.js` — transient messages; the `type` maps to `.toast-success/-error/-warning/-info`.
- `screens/` — one render function per route, all pure string templates.
- `three/` — persistent WebGL stage, quality-tier probe (T3/T2/T1), ship interior, camera rig.
- `quest3d/` — reusable containment chamber, `MOLECULE_DATA` (atoms, bonds and the
  pickable `regions` that double as anchor definitions), `InstancedMesh` renderer,
  MarchingCubes charge-density isosurfaces, and `evaluator.js`.
- `fallback2d/stages.js` — DOM-only inputs for Tier 1, producing the identical payload
  contract. Anchor labels are generated from region position and intensity
  ("Blue zone 2 — bright, lower right") so a player with no 3D view can still choose.

### Quest data — one source of truth
`src/quest3d/evaluator.js` owns the player-facing copy and the answers. It is in two
layers: `STAGE_CONFIGS` holds geometry, expected anchors, tolerance and reaction
animation, and `STAGE_COPY` holds everything the player reads — `shape`, `prompt`,
the three-rung `hints` ladder, the per-site `scans`, and the `concept` card plus its
`conceptTiming`. `STAGE_COPY` is folded onto `STAGE_CONFIGS` at module load so the
writing can be edited as writing; `cfg.hint` stays as an alias for `hints[0]` because
the backend has one `hint_text` column. Also exported: `evaluateStageLocally`,
`diagnoseMiss`, `scanFor`, `scansForStage`, `TOTAL_STAGES` and `TOTAL_QUEST_XP`.
Grading happens **in the browser at 0 ms**; the server call is fire-and-forget telemetry.
`CANONICAL_STAGES_20` in `api/[...route].js` and `DEFAULT_STAGES` in `apps-script/Quests.gs`
mirror the same titles and prompts — `npm run verify:quest` fails if they drift.

### API proxy (`api/[...route].js`)
Vercel catch-all. Performs `crypto.scrypt` password derivation (never sends plaintext to
Apps Script), rate limiting, salt caching, team-id normalization, and a 60 s in-memory cache
for public routes. When `APPS_SCRIPT_URL` is unset it falls back to `localDevHandler`, a
full in-memory mock of the backend — including the once-per-stage XP rule, so dev behaviour
matches production.

### Backend (`apps-script/`)
`Db.gs` (Sheets DAO), `Auth.gs`, `Players.gs`, `Quests.gs` (manifest, grading, hints,
completion), `Scoring.gs` (normalized leaderboards, level curve, level titles),
`Items.gs`, `Events.gs`, `Main.gs` (router + `setup()` for one-click sheet init).

## Rules that keep the game fair
- **XP is paid once per stage.** `Quests.gs` checks prior correct submissions, the proxy
  mock tracks `progress.cleared`, and the client only calls `session.addXp` when the stage
  is not a replay. Stage navigation lets players revisit any stage they have reached, so
  without this the Prev button is an infinite XP faucet.
- **Flat XP, no attempt multiplier.** The client grades locally and shows "+N XP" before the
  server replies; a server-side multiplier would contradict what the player was just told.
- **Hints are free** (`hint_cost: 0` on every stage). A stuck 8th grader should never be
  taxed for asking.
- **Completion is idempotent** — `completeQuest` returns the existing award if
  `Progress.completed_at` is already set, instead of minting another item.
- **Progress never regresses** — `stage_reached` is always `Math.max`'d.
- **The clean-solve streak pays nothing.** It counts stages cleared first try without the
  solution hint and is display only. Give it an XP value and it becomes an attempt
  multiplier, which the rule above forbids.
- **Hints are earned, not bought.** Rung 1 is free; rung 2 opens after one miss or 45 s;
  rung 3 opens after two misses. Nobody is ever stranded — but nobody is handed the answer
  before they have looked, either.

## Quest 1 — The Charge Gardens of Erebus
20 stages, 650 XP total.

**The loop is scan → compare → commit.** A prompt states the situation and the goal and
never the route; everything true about an individual site lives in that site's scan.
Tapping a site (a click with no drag, handled in `interactions/arrow.js` → `onProbe`)
rings it in the chamber and prints its readout: polarity, a 0–10 CHARGE bar, a 0–10
CLEARANCE bar, and one plain sentence. One scan is never enough — every stage is solved
by comparing two or more, which is what makes looking the core verb rather than reading.
Tier 1 gets the identical readout from a row of Site buttons.

A miss is answered by `diagnoseMiss`, which names the physics — TWO GIVERS, BACKWARDS,
TOO WEAK TO FIRE, PATH BLOCKED — and points at a site to go and scan. All 216 possible
wrong site-pairings across the quest resolve to a specific message; none fall through.

Concept cards are rewards, not briefings. `conceptTiming: 'intro'` is reserved for cards
that teach the *controls* (stage 1's scan/drag, stage 11's arrow ordering); every card
that explains a *concept* is `'reward'` and appears after the solve, under
"WHAT YOU JUST FOUND".
- Stages 1–7: one arrow. Red giver → blue receiver, then competing sites, then blocked
  paths that must be solved by rotating the view.
- Stages 8–10: three molecules in the chamber, including a bystander.
- Stages 11–20: two ordered arrows. Arrow badges are numbered; clicking a badge cycles its
  step, clicking an arrow deletes it. Wrong order is reported distinctly from a wrong move.
- Concept cards (bumper cars, two-handed handshakes, bent springs) appear after the solve
  on the stages that introduce a new idea, and can be hidden and reopened.
- A correct answer plays a physically honest 3D reaction: molecules approach along the
  collision vector, a bond snaps in, leaving groups depart, double bonds open and re-form,
  rings pop. The explainer appears **after** the animation, never on top of it.
  `playReaction` never strands the player on "Reacting…": a failed animation still
  resolves so the explainer and Next button appear.
- The stage briefing modal auto-shows only for genuinely new mechanics — stages 1, 5, 8,
  11 (`AUTO_MODAL_STAGES` in `quest.js`, plus any `conceptTiming: 'intro'` stage), once each
  and never on replay. Every other stage starts immediately; the Objective button reopens
  the briefing on demand.
- The bundled `STAGE_CONFIGS` are authoritative for everything rendered or graded
  (`moleculeId`, anchors derived from its regions, expected anchors, positions, tolerance,
  blocked sites, `reaction`, `multiArrow`, XP). Backend `scene_config` is transport only —
  a stale Sheets row must never swap in another stage's molecule.
- The epilogue (`QUEST1_EPILOGUE`, duplicated verbatim in `Quests.gs`, the proxy and
  `quest.js` as an offline fallback) is the single place real terminology is introduced.

`npm run verify:quest` asserts, for every stage: the molecule exists, every expected anchor
is actually rendered, the intended solution grades correct for the configured XP, a
backwards arrow fails, blocked targets report `blocked`, shuffled multi-arrow steps report
`wrongOrder`, the solution coordinates pass the proximity check, and no player-facing string
contains withheld vocabulary (electron, nucleophile, electrophile, carbonyl, carbocation,
alkyl, ester, epoxide, isopropyl).

It also asserts that **the scanner never lies**: every rendered region has a scan readout,
letters are unique, readings are 0–10, no decoy giver scans stronger than the answer, no
*reachable* decoy taker scans hungrier than the answer, a `blockedAnchor` scans ≤ 3
clearance, every stage has exactly three distinct hint rungs, and a giver→giver submission
is diagnosed as `TWO GIVERS` rather than falling through to a generic miss.

## Player journey
1. `#/` landing — what this is, three cards (Play / Score / Compete), and a free sample.
2. `#/demo` — Stage 1 for real, no account, graded by the same evaluator.
3. `#/register` — step 1 of 3 on the shared `stepRail`. Live validation mirrors
   `validateDisplayName` in `Util.gs` exactly, so no rule bites only at submit time.
4. `#/onboarding` — step 2. Four teams with guild names and live slot counts.
5. `#/bridge` — step 3. Resume/start CTA, progress bar, XP, level and team conditions.
6. `#/quest` → `#/leaderboard`, `#/inventory`, `#/quarters`, `#/settings`, `#/admin`.

Nav labels match page titles exactly: BRIDGE, STAR MAP, STANDINGS, INVENTORY, CREW.

## Aesthetic — "SCOURED PLATE" (MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS)

Every screen, component and 3D scene obeys one brief: **hardware that has been in the
dust for forty years and still works.** Advanced technology, poorly maintained. The
reference points are the used-universe of a desert-planet space opera — never named in
player-facing copy, only felt.

### 1. The three material rules
Read `src/styles/tokens.css` before styling anything; it is the contract.
1. **Surfaces are warm dark.** The neutral scale (`--plate-000`…`--plate-600`) carries a
   brown/sand bias. Never the blue-black of a generic dark-mode website.
2. **Light is filament, not LED.** Amber comes from inside a thing, dim and local.
   *Nothing blooms.* A `box-shadow: 0 0 20px <colour>` is the single loudest tell of
   vibe-coded design and is banned. The only exceptions are things that are literally
   lamps: `.gfx-dot`, `.stage-dot.active`, `.stage-dot.completed`.
3. **Amber is a signal, not a surface.** If it is lit, something is live. Paint the whole
   UI with it and it means nothing.

### 2. Banned outright
Neon and synthwave glow; electric cyan (`#00e5ff`); glossy blue glassmorphism; candy
gradient buttons with white specular highlights; rounded corners (`--radius-sm` is `0`);
**emoji anywhere in player-facing markup**; Tailwind-default palette hexes (`#fbbf24`,
`#10b981`, `#ff5252`); auto-fit grids of "feature cards" advertising what the product does.

### 3. Geometry and texture
- Machined plate has **cut corners, not rounded ones**. `.plate`, `.glass-panel`,
  `.holo-card` and `.stage-prompt-card` share one treatment: a `clip-path` chamfer plus a
  matching hairline drawn as a 45° background gradient in the relieved corner.
- Every large surface is sandblasted — a shared `--grain` noise tile at 3–4 % opacity via
  `::before`, `mix-blend-mode: overlay`. Because a pseudo-element is not matched by
  `> *`, the `position: relative` on direct children keeps content above the grain.
- Seams are physical: `--seam-light` on the lamp-facing top edge, `--seam-dark` below.
- Type is **engraved** (`--engrave`, a dark line under the glyph), never glowing.

### 4. Colour
- Surfaces: `--plate-*`. Seams: `--border-durasteel`, `--seam-light/dark`.
- Signals: `--accent-amber` `#d99423`, `--accent-gold`, `--accent-rust`, `--accent-green`
  `#6f8f3f`, `--accent-danger` `#a8342a`, `--accent-bronze`. Filaments: `--lamp-*`.
- Guild liveries: `--team-earth/air/fire/water`. **The HUD badge derives its livery from
  `TEAM_LIVERY` in `main.js`, never from the sheet's `accent_hex`** — a stale hex in the
  Teams tab used to leak a bright web colour into the header.
- **Charge red `#ff1744` and blue `#00b0ff` are reserved for the chemistry** and appear in
  the 3D chamber only. In UI chrome they appear as printed ink on a hairline rule
  (`--charge-red-ink`, `--charge-blue-ink`) — the polarity key, `.scan-readout` left
  border, `.concept-pill` left border — never as a glowing block or a rainbow ramp.

### 5. Typography
- Page titles: `Cinzel` (`--font-imperial`) via `.page-title` — uppercase, tracked wide.
- Section and card headings: `Chakra Petch` (`--font-display`) via `.section-title`.
- Telemetry, labels, kickers, helper text: `Share Tech Mono` (`--font-mono`) via
  `.eyebrow` (`.lit` when live), `.stat-value`, `.tag`, `.form-label`, `.form-help`.
- Body: `Rajdhani` (`--font-main`).

### 6. Components
- **Panels**: `.glass-panel` / `.plate`. Banner art goes in `.panel-banner` — desaturated,
  dimmed and sepia-shifted behind a scanline, so it reads as a viewport, not a hero image.
- **Switchgear**: `.btn-primary` is a painted key cap (matte amber plate, engraved dark
  legend, physical bottom lip, sinks on press). `.btn-secondary` is bare durasteel.
  `.quest-btn-sm` is compact quest chrome. Labels are 1–2 words; **no arrow glyphs.**
- **Inputs**: `.form-input` is a recessed well; focus turns the text amber rather than
  adding a halo. `.choice-option` is a toggle with a lit left edge when selected.
- **Banners**: `.form-banner` for faults; in the quest, `.stage-error-banner` with
  `.banner-mark` / `.banner-title` / `.banner-body` / `.banner-meta`. The leading mark is
  a stencilled `!!` or `//`, never an emoji.
- **Scanner**: `.scan-readout` is a cathode instrument — phosphor raster, segment meters,
  one beam sweep per read.
- **Factions**: four Imperial Guilds — Mineral Mining (Earth), Atmospheric Harvesters
  (Air), Thermal Smelters (Fire), Moisture Extraction (Water), shown as two-letter mono
  designators (MM / AH / TS / ME). Legacy ids `terra`, `zephyr`, `ignis`, `thalassa` are
  auto-migrated everywhere.

### 7. Copy discipline
The interface does not advertise itself. Delete any string that is not (a) a label,
(b) a rule the player must satisfy, (c) an error, or (d) something being taught.
- **No feature marketing.** The landing page is a name plate and two switches.
- **A quest is described by three things and nothing else**: where it happens, its title,
  and one short line. Sector 01 is `Erebus · Desert world / The Charge Gardens / "Find
  what pulls. Draw the line."` — that is the template.
- Screens carry no subtitle unless it is that one line.
- **The teaching copy is exempt.** Prompts, `scans`, the three hint rungs, `diagnoseMiss`
  messages, concept cards and the epilogue are the product; they are trimmed for
  tightness, never for length.

### 8. 3D and assets
- Nano Banana (`generate_image`) matte textures with Three.js procedural geometry and
  `MeshStandardMaterial`.
- Starship cockpit: faceted durasteel canopy mullions, overhead avionics rack, dual analog
  yokes, throttle quadrant, armored bucket seats, twin CRT monitors.
- Celestial vista: chromatic gas giant with rings, the banded desert planet Erebus, moons,
  an asteroid belt. Stars are blue-white and sand-gold, not neon.
- Lighting: cool starlight through the canopy, warm sodium instrument task lamps, dust motes.
- Routes bind environment stills: `/art/cockpit.jpg`, `starmap.jpg`, `crucible.jpg`,
  `cargo.jpg`, `quarters.jpg`, `comms.jpg`, `airlock.jpg`.

### 9. Layout invariants
- `--hud-h` is the height of the fixed header. `.app-viewport` padding and the fixed
  `.quest-hud-overlay` both derive from it; nothing may slide under the HUD.
- Everything must work at 375 px wide. Media queries at 900 px / 760 px / 620 px collapse
  the HUD, hide the legend and secondary chrome, shrink the chamfer, and cap the stage
  card height.
